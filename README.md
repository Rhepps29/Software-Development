# Software Development
  Hello! My name is Ryker Hepworth. I am taking a college class at Southwest Tech. The course is titled Software Development (Computer Programming).
  The point of this repository is to contain assignments for this class and create a larger portfolio
  I am a junior in high school, have travelled to 5 of the seven continents, and can speak German and English. I have maintained a 4.0 for my entire life and love math and all stem programs. My goal is to go into some form of computer programming or mathmatics field in college and excel and grow as a person.
